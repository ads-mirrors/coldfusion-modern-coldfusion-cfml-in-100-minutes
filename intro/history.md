# What is ColdFusion (CFML)

ColdFusion Markup Language \<CFML> is a dynamic web programming language, which is especially suited for new developers as it was written to make a programmer's job easy and not care if the computer's job is hard. ColdFusion's main goal is to be a rapid application development scripting language and middleware. It integrates with many technologies to provide you with an out-of-the-box language that makes things **easy**. In this brief introduction we'll look at key language features you need to get started.

## Going Deep

ColdFusion (CFML) is an interpreted and [dynamic ECMA Script like language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic\_programming\_language) that compiles to [Java Bytecode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java\_bytecode) directly, thus running in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and in almost every operating system. Implementations of the language are mostly done by two parties: [Adobe ColdFusion](http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion-family.html) (Commercial) and [Lucee Server](http://lucee.org/) (Free & Open Source) and saw its beginnings in 1995. It is a mature and modern language and development platform. You can discover all the versions here: [https://cfdocs.org/coldfusion-versions](https://cfdocs.org/coldfusion-versions)

## Developing with ColdFusion

All examples shown in this book will be done leveraging CommandBox as the de-facto standard for ColdFusion (CFML) development.

[CommandBox](https://www.ortussolutions.com/products/commandbox) is a standalone, native tool for Windows, Mac, and Linux that will provide you with a Command Line Interface (CLI) for developer productivity, tool interaction, package management, REPL, embedded ColdFusion/Java server, application scaffolding, and some sweet ASCII art.

## ColdFusion Docs Reference

The best way for discovering the methods, tags and functionality of the ColdFusion language is to leverage [cfdocs.org](https://cfdocs.org/). Make sure you open it and bookmark it.
