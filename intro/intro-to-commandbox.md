## Installation

CommandBox is a Java-based executable that will run on most recent desktop operating systems (Linux, Mac OS X, Windows). Since it is a command line tool that uses a shell interface, it does not even require an operating system using a GUI. Below is a simple guideline to get you up and running, but an [in-depth guide](https://commandbox.ortusbooks.com/content/setup/) can be found here:

### Requirements

* 256MB+ RAM
* 250MB+ free hard drive space
* Multi-core CPU recommended
* JRE/JDK 7+

### Download

If you already have a Java JRE installed level 1.7 or higher (and set in your environment variables) you can [download](http://www.ortussolutions.com/products/commandbox#download) the non-JRE version for your Operating System. If you don't have a JRE installed or aren't sure, we would recommend you [download](http://www.ortussolutions.com/products/commandbox#download) the version with a JRE included.

Regardless of where you place the **box** binary, the first time you execute it, a `.CommandBox` folder will be created in your user's home directory and CommandBox will be extracted into that location. If you delete this directory, it will be replaced the next time the CommandBox executable is run.

#### Windows

Unzip the executable **box.exe** and just double click on it to open the shell. When you are finished running commands, you can just close the window, or type `exit`.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Hint:** You can make the `box.exe` available in any Window's terminal by adding its location to the `PATH` system environment variable. See [http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm](http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm)
{% endhint %}

#### Homebrew (Mac)

[Homebrew](http://brew.sh) is a great Mac package manager, it can easily install and keep your CommandBox installation up to date (even binary releases), just run the following for stable releases:

```bash
brew install commandbox
```

To stay with current bleeding edge releases use the following:

```bash
brew tap ortus-solutions/boxtap
brew tap-pin ortus-solutions/boxtap
brew install --devel commandbox
```

Then run the `box` binary to begin the one-time unpacking process.

Versions will be installed in `/usr/local/Cellar/commandbox`. To switch between versions, simply use `brew switch commandbox [version number]`

#### Manual Linux/Mac

Unzip the binary **box** and just double click on it to open the shell terminal. When you are finished running commands, you can just close the window, or type `exit`.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Hint** You can place the binary in your `/usr/bin` or `/usr/local/bin` directory so it can be available system-wide via the box command in any terminal window.
{% endhint %}

#### Linux apt-get

Run the following series of commands to add the Ortus signing key, register our Debian repo, and install CommandBox.

```bash
curl -fsSl https://downloads.ortussolutions.com/debs/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://downloads.ortussolutions.com/debs/noarch /" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/commandbox.list
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install commandbox
```

#### Linux yum

Add the following to: `/etc/yum.repos.d/commandbox.repo`

```bash
[CommandBox]
name=CommandBox $releasever - $basearch
failovermethod=priority
baseurl=http://downloads.ortussolutions.com/RPMS/noarch
enabled=1
metadata_expire=7d
gpgcheck=0
```

Then run a `sudo yum install commandbox` and be up and running
