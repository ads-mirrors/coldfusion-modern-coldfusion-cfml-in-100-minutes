# Welcome

Welcome to the wonderful world of dynamic programming with ColdFusion (CFML).  This book aims to jump-start developers into the ColdFusion (CFML) programming language from a modern perspective and focus on best practices, object orientation, and tooling.  ColdFusion is not the same as it was 20 years ago; yes, it's more than 20 years old!  It's dynamic, vibrant, modern, fluent, and functional!  Let's begin our adventure into the world of MODERN ColdFusion (CFML).

{% hint style="info" %}
This book is inspired by the original [Ruby in 100 minutes](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/ruby\_in\_100\_minutes.html), [Mike Henke's work on CFML in 100 minutes](https://github.com/mhenke/CFML-in-100-minutes/wiki), and [Learn CF in a week series](http://www.learncfinaweek.com/).&#x20;

## ColdFusion vs. CFML

Let's get this ambiguity out of the way.  **ColdFusion** is the server product, and **CFML** is the language, short for **C**oldFusion **M**arkup **L**anguage.  In turn, ColdFusion is actually the platform or framework in which CFML scripts are executed. It is similar to the relationship between HTML and a web browser like IE, Firefox, or Safari.

CFML will execute in a ColdFusion engine.
